We're getting closer to the deployment of xDXdao (DXdao on xDAI), after several discussions in various calls over the past few weeks it seems that the leading narrative for the DAO will be an xDAI DXdao Base. Below you can find a bit more information about what this DAO will do. 

If all goes well, the DAO will be deployed on **Monday, October 5th, 2020,** On Alchemy arcv2 on xDAI. With a Reputation snapshot and removal of all un-remapped gnosis safes (They can add themselves lateR)

*Kind reminder that if you have gnosis safe and haven't mapped your reputation you will have to do this later by yourself.
 instructions here below* 

     How to map your reputation:
     1. Go to https://etherscan.io/address/0x458c390a29c6bed4aec37499b525b95eb0de217d#writeContract
     2. Connect your DXdao wallet
     3. In the topic put:  0xac3e2276e49f2e2937cb1feecb361dd733fd0de8711789aadbd4013a2e0dac14
     which is hashed 'xDAI' 
     4. in the value put your destination ETH address
     5. Cick write

### The xDXdao MVP will be focused on:
   - Govern DXdao xDAI products (e.g. Omen xDAI deployment)
        - (Curating Omen Markets?)
   - Faster, cheaper, less secure DAO that holds funds for immediate activities - Paying for bounties, competitions, and ad-hoc payments)
        - DXswap Marketing efforts? https://daotalk.org/t/dxdao-xdai-deployment-discussion/1976/9
   - Signaling on proposals and decisions, with monthly / quarterly aggregation and 'Ratification' on the Main-net DAO. (e.g. Strategy/Signaling DAO)
   - Second iteration: 
        - HR-DAO - This DAO is funded Monthly / Quarterly with the compensation budget of DXdao workers, this will significantly reduce gas costs on mainnet and allow the distribution of funds in DAI stable coin instead of ETH.
- Issues:
    - Reputation separation between xDXdao and DXdao
        - Solution: a monthly / quarterly update of reputation between the two DAOs (can register reputation admin to the DXdao, or for this to be done manually)
        - Update process **Manually** --> 
            - Understand how much the rep balance change in the other network and add that manually every quarter.
            - DXdao Rep mint (Q2 xDXdao Rep balance - Q1 xDXdao rep snapshot)
            - xDXdao Rep mint (Q2 DXdao Rep balance - Q1 DXdao rep snapshot)
    - Transferring funds between the DAO, at the moment there is no 'trustless' way of sending funds between the chains
        - Solution: A few individuals (multisig?) will ask for the funds in a new account, and transfer the full amount to the xDXdao (ETH -> DAI -> xDAI ->  xDXdao)


### To do / To discuss
- Proposal to Transfer funds from DXdao to xDXdao - 10k USD to start with
- Finalize Reputation mapping
- Finalize DAO goals outlined in this Document (Governance call @Powers)
