    question: "What revenues does the Dxdao have?",
    answer: "The Dxdao recently launched Mesa.eth.link, a front end to the Gnosis Protocol DEX, has plans to imminently launch a prediction market platform, and has started work on a privacy-centric DeFi dashboard. All of these DeFi products offer the potential for fee-based revenue to the DXdao. Its treasury holds various capital assets, some of which garner revenues or rewards from other projects or DAOs."
  },
  {
    question: "What does the Dxdao currently own or operate?",
    answer: "The Dxdao is owner of 8 ENS domains (Mesa.eth, DXdao.eth, DXoasis.eth, DutchX.eth, DXinsurance.eth, DXoracle.eth, DXwallet.eth, DXfeeds.eth). It also holds cryptocurrencies worth more then $10,000 USD, including GEN (DAOstackâ€™s native token), ETH, GNO, DMM and more. The Dxdao is operating the open source trading interface https://Mesa.eth.link for the Gnosis Protocol.  "

  {
    question: "Who owns the Dxdao?",
    answer: "The Dxdao is owned by its stakeholders, otherwise known as \"reputation holders\". Your proportion of the dao's reputation determines your voting weight. This reputation is owned by Ethereum addresses that collectively control the set of smart contracts that is the Dxdao, and the projects it administers. Some Dxdao members assert themselves as the owners of certain addresses, other address owners are anonymous."
  },
  {
    question: "How many people are in the Dxdao?",
    answer: "There are currently over 400 Ethereum addresses with reputation in the Dxdao. How many unique individuals control these addresses is unknowable - it can be fewer people (if one person owns several addresses), or more people (if addresses are owned by multiple users via a multisig wallet."
  },
  {
    question: "How does one become a member of the Dxdao?",
    answer: "Becoming a member of the Dxdao requires having reputation granted to you by the Dxdao itself. This is done by a proposal which is put to a vote. For example: a potential member requests 1% of reputation (to their Ethereum address) for work completed, or value added in any way. DxDAO members can then cast on-chain votes weighted by reputation. If the proposal passes, the new member is automatically granted their reputation."
  },
  {
    question: "How does decision making happen in the Dxdao?",
    answer: "The Dxdao reputation holders vote on proposals on-chain, using DAOstack's alchemy interface and holographic consensus. This means some proposals can pass by a relative majority, and other times an absolute majority is needed. This depends on the type of proposal, and if someone boosts the proposal by reaching a specific threshold on a prediction market. In general, though, the Dxdao coalesces around ideas and achieves rough consensus via off-chain, less formal methods, such as our weekly calls, discussion forums, chat groups, etc. All of these are open to the public."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between DXD and reputation?",
    answer: "DXD is the economic token of the Dxdao. It is a transferrable erc-20 token which grants its holders a right to the revenue of the Dxdao, as well as certain privileges or premier service on Dxdao-owned products. Reputation is the governance mechanism that controls the Dxdao. It is non-transferrable and holders have a right - and implicit duty - to govern and direct the collective. DXD and reputation holders need not overlap, but it is likely some part of each stakeholder group will hold both to more tightly couple their interests. As holding DXD is the more passive path - and the one tied to economic success - it will likely be the more widley owned stake in the system."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the Dxdao's grand goal?",
    answer: "The Dxdao is a collective of people with a shared vision of a flourishing financial system on Ethereum. We work to ensure that this financial system is decentralized, and can fulfill its promises of permissionless-ness, privacy, and permanence. We leverage our on-chain, transparent, and resilient structure to own and operate critical protocols, products, and services for this space."
  },
  {
    question: "How does the Dxdao come to own and operate these protocols, products, or services?",
    answer:  <pre>
      In some cases, we build them - either by existing Dxdao members directly, or by soliciting non-members for the work required. This is what much of our treasury will fund.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      In other cases, projects and assets are bequeathed or granted to the Dxdao from other organizations, in exchange for services to be performed, such as running or maintaining a system or product. 
      Organizations typically seek to place their products or assets in the control of the Dxdao, or request service from the Dxdao in times where a higher degree of decentralization is required. 
      Such services can include governing on-chain protocols, hosting UIs and other infrastructure, or arbitrating disputes.
