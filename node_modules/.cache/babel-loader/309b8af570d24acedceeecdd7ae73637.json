All of these DeFi products offer the potential for fee-based revenue to the DXdao. Its treasury holds various capital assets, some of which garner revenues or rewards from other projects or DAOs.\"\n}, {\n  question: \"What does the DXdao currently own or operate?\",\n  answer: \"The DXdao is owner of 8 ENS domains (Mesa.eth, DXdao.eth, DXoasis.eth, DutchX.eth, DXinsurance.eth, DXoracle.eth, DXwallet.eth, DXfeeds.eth). It also holds cryptocurrencies worth more than $10,000 USD, including GEN (DAOstack’s native token), ETH, DMM and more. The DXdao is operating the open source trading interface https://Mesa.eth.link for the Gnosis Protocol.\"\n}, {\n  question: \"Who owns the DXdao?\",\n  answer: \"The DXdao is owned by its stakeholders, otherwise known as \\\"reputation holders\\\". Your proportion of the dao's reputation determines your voting weight. This reputation is owned by Ethereum addresses that collectively control the set of smart contracts that is the DXdao, and the projects it administers. Some DXdao members assert themselves as the owners of certain addresses, other address owners are anonymous.\"\n}, {\n  question: \"How many people are in the DXdao?\",\n  answer: \"There are currently over 400 Ethereum addresses with reputation in the DXdao. How many unique individuals control these addresses is unknowable - it can be fewer people (if one person owns several addresses), or more people (if addresses are owned by multiple users via a multisig wallet.\"\n}, {\n  question: \"How does one become a member of the DXdao?\",\n  answer: \"Becoming a member of the DXdao requires having reputation granted to you by the DXdao itself. This is done by a proposal which is put to a vote. For example: a potential member requests 1% of reputation (to their Ethereum address) for work completed, or value added in any way. DXdao members can then cast on-chain votes weighted by reputation. If the proposal passes, the new member is automatically granted their reputation.\"\n}, {\n  question: \"How does decision making happen in the DXdao?\",\n  answer: \"The DXdao reputation holders vote on proposals on-chain, using DAOstack's alchemy interface and holographic consensus. This means some proposals can pass by a relative majority, and other times an absolute majority is needed. This depends on the type of proposal, and if the proposal is boosted by reaching a specific staking threshold. In general, though, the DXdao coalesces around ideas and achieves rough consensus via off-chain, less formal methods, such as weekly calls, discussion forums, chat groups, etc. All of these are open to the public.\"\n}, {\n  question: \"What is the difference between DXD and reputation?\",\n  answer: /*#__PURE__*/React.createElement(\"pre\", {\n    __self: this,\n    __source: {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 30,\n      columnNumber: 13\n    }\n  }, \"DXD is the economic token of the DXdao.
